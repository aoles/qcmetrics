#+TITLE: A General Framework for Quality Control Metrics

The =qcmetrics= package provides a general framework to develope
quality control (QC) pipelines for any type of data that can be
imported into =R=. The application of =qcmetrics= can be schematised
in 4 points

1. Identify a set of quality metrics of interest and implement them
   and their visualisation method into individual =QcMetric=
   instances.
2. Bundles the =QcMetric= items into a =QcMetrics= instance. 
3. Automatically generate reports in pdf of html using the =qcReport=
   function using the =QcMetrics= object of step 2 as input.
4. Optionally, reports can be customised. 
5. Wrap the above steps into a wrapper function or a new QC package
   for production use.

QC pipelines and packages will be described and disseminated through the [[https://github.com/lgatto/qcmetrics/wiki][wiki]].
